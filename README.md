# Portfolio
A personal project to showcase my expertise in .NET Fullstack Development, as well as a means to get around LinkedIn's 50 skills limit. The site utilises React.js for the frontend, ASP.NET Core + EntityFramework Core for the API, and Microsoft SQL Server for the database. As of now, there isn't too much in terms of the website. In the future, a more feature-rich site will be set up as well as various different backend functionalities.

## Local testing
  - ### Prerequesites
    - Code environment and any necessary setup needed to run ASP.NET. I mainly use VS 2022, but VS Code can run it too.
    - NodeJS for WebClient.
    - Microsoft SQL Server. No encryption setup needed for local instance. Connection string included in appsettings.development.

  - ### WebClient
    - Run ```npm i``` to install the packages.
    - Run ```npm run dev``` to start.
   
  - ### WebApi
    - Setup mentioned in [Prerequesites](#prerequesites).
